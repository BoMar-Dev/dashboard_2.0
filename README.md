# CGI DASHBOARD
## _Internal Dashboard for weekly and monthly overview

5 months of school are spent on an internship @ CGI CGD Åre/Östersund. Here I take over a design that a UX (former intern) has designed.
I will then develop this design which is a Dashboard that will be used by the company internally
The main focus will be to creat the MVP for the product.

## Tech

The dashboard uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework for quickly building custom designs.
- [DateFns](https://date-fns.org/) - Modern JavaScript date utility library.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- [Multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer) - Node.js middleware for handling `multipart/form-data`.
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) - An open-source relational database management system.
