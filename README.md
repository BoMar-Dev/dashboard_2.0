------------------------------Intro------------------------------------------------------------
5 months of school are spent on an internship @ CGI CGD Åre/Östersund. Here I take over a design that a UX (former intern) has designed.
I will then develop this design which is a Dashboard that will be used by the company internally
The main focus will be to creat the MVP for the product.
