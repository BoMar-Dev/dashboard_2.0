# CGI Dashboard

Welcome to the CGI Dashboard repository!

This project involves a 5-month internship at CGI CGD Åre/Östersund, where the primary task is to develop an internal dashboard. The dashboard, originally designed by a former UX intern, is now under development to create a functional tool for internal use within the company.

## Objective
The main focus of this internship is to develop the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the dashboard. This involves taking over the existing design and implementing the necessary features to provide a comprehensive overview for weekly and monthly activities.

## Features
### GDC Åre
- Weekly calendar displaying dates, current day, and holidays.
- Monthly calendar showcasing events for the current month.
- Widgets including a shopping list, responsibilities, weekly challenges, and birthdays.

### Gallery
- Image Slider for visual content display.
- Image file uploader for adding new content to the gallery.

## Design
The initial design of the dashboard was crafted by UX designer Johanna Sarskog. You can explore her portfolio [here](https://jsarskog.myportfolio.com/).

## Technology Stack

The dashboard uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework for quickly building custom designs.
- [DateFns](https://date-fns.org/) - Modern JavaScript date utility library.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- [Multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer) - Node.js middleware for handling `multipart/form-data`.
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) - An open-source relational database management system.
